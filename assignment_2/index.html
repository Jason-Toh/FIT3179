                    <h1>Crimes in New York City</h1>
                    <p>
                        Crimes are prevalent everywhere, whether it be the cities, suburbs or the countrysides.
                        While achieving a zero percent crime rate is considered to be near impossible by many experts,
                        it is however possible to analyse the statistics of these crimes in hopes of minimizing the number of crimes
                        occuring at a time.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        There are many types of crimes that exists in New York City. 
                        Some can be mild which the offender only need to pay a fine 
                        while there are others which are very serious that can be land in life
                        imprisonment or even the death penalty.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This visualisation aims to analyse the crimes in one of most 
                        well known cities in USA which is New York City.

                        From observation, we can see that Bronx despite having lesser population than Brookyln
                        has a higher crime rate than them.
                        <br>
                        Staten island has smallest crime rate which makes them the safest borough

                        Crimes can be distinguished into two categories which are property crime and violent crime. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Violent crime consists of Harrassment, Kidnapping, Murder and Rape.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Property crime consists of Arson, Larceny and Property Theft.

                    <p>
                        The radial plot has shown that Property Theft has taken the first place in most frequent type of crime (29%).
                        Followed by Larcerny (24%), Murder (19%), Rape (28%) and finally a three way tie between Arson, Harrassment and Kidnapping with (3%).

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Property crimes are generally more common than violent crimes as offenders of violent crimes 
                        are more aggresive in their nature when committing those type of crimes.

                        Between the two genders, Male has consistently commit more crimes than females in any age group.

                        From observation, it can be seen that individuals from the 25-44
                        age group commits the most crime compared to other age group wheareas the 65+
                        commits the least crime.

                        <br>

                        One possible reasoning is that younger people have more natural strength compared to older people
                        as well as poorer social status (FutureLearn, n.d.).

                    </p>
                    <p>The waffle chart shows the distribution of races when it comes to commiting an offence.
                        Interestingly, we can see that half of the reported offences are committed by Black Americans
                        with a percentage of 53% while White Americans are only 9%.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        According to Srikanth (2020), Black americans are 5 times more likely to be arrested than their
                        white counterparts in 800 jurisdictions across the USA.
