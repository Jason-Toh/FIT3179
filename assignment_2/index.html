                    <h1>Crimes in New York City</h1>
                    <p>
                        Crimes are prevalent everywhere, whether it be the cities, suburbs or the countrysides.
                        While achieving a zero percent crime rate is considered to be near impossible by many experts,
                        it is however possible to analyse the statistics of these crimes in hopes of minimizing the number of crimes
                        occuring at a time.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        There are many types of crimes that exists in New York City. 
                        Some can be mild which the offender only need to pay a fine 
                        while there are others which are very serious that can be land in life
                        imprisonment or even the death penalty.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This visualisation aims to analyse the crimes in one of most 
                        well known cities in USA which is New York City.

                        Crimes can be distinguished into two categories which are property crime and violent crime.

                        Property crimes are generally more common than violent crimes as offenders of violent crimes 
                        are more aggresive in their nature when committing those type of crimes.

                        From observation, it can be seen that individuals from the 25-44
                        age group commits the most crime compared to other age group wheareas the 65+
                        commits the least crime.

                        One possible reasoning is that younger people have more natural strength compared to older people
                        as well as poorer social status (FutureLearn, n.d.).

                    <p>The waffle chart shows the distribution of races when it comes to commiting an offence.
                        Interestingly, we can see that half of the reported offences are committed by <span id=black>Black</span> Americans
                        with a percentage of 53% while <span id=white>White</span> Americans are only 9%.

                        <br>

                        According to Srikanth (2020), Black americans are 5 times more likely to be arrested than their
                        white counterparts in 800 jurisdictions across the USA.
