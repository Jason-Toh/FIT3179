                        Based on the choropleth map shown on the left, <b>Brookyln</b> is seen as the hotspot area for crimes to occur. However, part of the reason can be attributed to the fact that it is the most populated borough with a population of 2.5 million people.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Staten island's crime rate is the lowest. However, it does have a population of 470k.

                        Therefore, one should not look just the number of crime but also at the general population at that vicinity.

                        Does crime have a distinction between age, gender and race?

                        We see that most frequent age group that likely commits a crime lies in 25-44 age group.

                        Another observation can be seen that Males are more likely to commit crimes than females across all the age groups.

                        More than half of the crimes are reported to be Black which has 53% overall. The second largest demographic race is the white hispanic with 25%.

                        The smallest demographic race to commit a crime are the Asians which has 4%.
